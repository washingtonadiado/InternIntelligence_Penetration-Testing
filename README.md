## Overview

During my internship at Intern Intelligence, I completed Task One of the Web Application Penetration Testing track on the TryHackMe platform. This hands‑on lab simulates real‑world web application vulnerabilities, allowing me to practice identifying and exploiting common security flaws in a controlled environment.

## Objectives

- **Identify common web application vulnerabilities**: Discover flaws such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Broken Authentication.  
- **Exploit discovered vulnerabilities**: Demonstrate impact and potential risks by exploiting each flaw.  
- **Document findings**: Produce clear, actionable reports with remediation recommendations.

## Tools & Techniques

- **OWASP ZAP**: Automated vulnerability scanning.  
- **Burp Suite**: Intercepting proxy for manual testing and detailed traffic analysis.  
- **Manual Testing**: Tailored payload crafting and logic validation.  
- **Kali Linux**: Dedicated penetration testing environment with pre-installed tools.

## Key Activities

1. **Assessment & Scanning**  
   - Launched OWASP ZAP to perform an initial scan of the application.  
   - Analyzed scan results to prioritize high-risk endpoints.

2. **Manual Testing & Exploitation**  
   - Used Burp Suite to intercept requests and manipulate parameters.  
   - Exploited SQL Injection by injecting SQL payloads into form fields.  
   - Identified XSS vulnerabilities and tested payloads to confirm client‑side script execution.  
   - Tested authentication flows to uncover Broken Authentication weaknesses.

3. **Reporting & Documentation**  
   - Compiled all findings into a structured report.  
   - Provided remediation recommendations for each identified issue, following OWASP guidelines.

## Outcome

- Gained hands‑on experience identifying and exploiting key web application vulnerabilities.  
- Enhanced proficiency with OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite in a real‑world scenario.  
- Delivered a comprehensive report detailing vulnerabilities, impacts, and remediation steps.

## How to Reproduce
